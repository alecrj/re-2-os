# ResellerOS - North Star

> This document defines the vision and non-negotiables.
> Last Updated: 2026-02-03 (Phase 2 - Planning)

## Vision

**Turn photos into profits across every marketplace.**

ResellerOS is the operating system for resellers who want to spend more time sourcing and less time on repetitive platform tasks. We automate the grind so you can focus on the hunt.

## The Promise

> **User only does:**
> 1. Take photos
> 2. Ship sold orders
>
> **The app does everything else.**

This means:
- AI generates listings from your photos
- One click cross-lists to all marketplaces
- Sales auto-sync (no double-selling)
- Smart repricing runs on autopilot
- Real profit calculated automatically

## Non-Negotiables

These are the principles we will NEVER compromise on:

### 1. Profit Truth
- Show real net profit after ALL costs (fees, shipping, COGS, returns)
- No vanity metrics - if you lost money, we tell you
- Weekly proof the tool pays for itself

### 2. Account Safety
- No ToS violations, ever
- "Assisted over sketchy" - we help you do things faster, not break rules
- If a feature risks your account, we do not build it

### 3. User Control
- Automation with guardrails, not blind bots
- Confidence thresholds on AI decisions
- Full audit logs - see what happened and why
- One-click undo for any automated action
- Human-in-the-loop for edge cases

### 4. Cross-Listing from Day One
- eBay native (full API access)
- Other platforms via assisted workflows
- One listing, everywhere, optimized per platform

### 5. Measurable ROI
- You should KNOW the tool is worth the subscription
- Dashboard shows time saved and profit gained
- If we are not delivering value, you should cancel

## What We Are NOT Building (MVP)

| Feature | Why Not |
|---------|---------|
| Poshmark auto-sharing | ToS violation risk |
| Auto-following/bot offers | Account ban risk |
| International marketplaces | Complexity, focus on US first |
| VA/team features | Solo reseller focus for v1 |
| Inventory location/SKU management | Physical problem, not software |
| Dispute/return automation | Requires human judgment |
| Shipping carrier negotiation | Third-party dependency |
| Mobile app | Web-first MVP, mobile v2 |

## What "Winning" Means

| Metric | Target | How Measured |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Listing Velocity | 2x faster | Time from photo to live listing |
| Sell-Through Rate | +15-30% | Items sold / items listed over 90 days |
| Weekly ROI Visible | Yes | Dashboard shows tool value vs subscription |
| Account Suspensions | Zero | From ResellerOS automation |
| User Retention (30-day) | >70% | Active users after first month |

## Target User

**Full-Time Frank** (primary persona):
- 40-50 hours/week reselling
- 500-2000 active listings
- Pain: "Cannot keep up with inventory management"
- Willingness to pay: $50-100/mo

**Side Hustle Sarah** (secondary):
- 10-15 hours/week
- 50-100 listings
- Pain: "No time for multiple platforms"
- Willingness to pay: $10-20/mo

We are NOT targeting Power Sellers with VAs (5000+ listings) in MVP.

## Competitive Positioning

| Us | Them |
|----|------|
| Real profit visibility | Vanity sales metrics |
| ToS-compliant automation | Risky bots that get accounts banned |
| Trustable automation (audit, undo) | Black-box "magic" |
| "Photos + Shipping Only" promise | Still requires hours of manual work |
