# ResellerOS - North Star

> This document defines the vision and non-negotiables.
> Updated in Phase 2: Planning.

## Vision
[To be defined in Phase 2]

## The Promise
User only does:
1. Take photos
2. Ship sold orders

The app does everything else.

## Non-Negotiables
- [ ] Cross-listing from day one (eBay native, others assisted)
- [ ] Autopilot with guardrails (not blind automation)
- [ ] Profit truth (real net, not vibes)
- [ ] Trustable automation (audit logs, undo, confidence thresholds)
- [ ] No ToS violations (assisted > sketchy automation)

## What "Winning" Means
- 2x listing velocity
- +15-30% sell-through from autopilot
- Measurable weekly ROI shown in app

## What We're NOT Building
[To be defined in Phase 2]

## Status
- **Current**: Template (Phase 0)
- **Updated**: 2026-02-03
- **Next Update**: Phase 2 (Planning)
