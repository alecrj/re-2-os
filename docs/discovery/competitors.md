> Discovery Document - SUBTASK-102
> Created: 2026-02-03

## Executive Summary

The reseller software market is crowded with crosslisting tools, but most focus on the same core problem: reducing manual work when listing across multiple marketplaces. Key gaps exist in **true profit visibility**, **intelligent automation with guardrails**, and **ToS-compliant automation**. ResellerOS can differentiate by delivering on the "user only takes photos and ships" promise while providing real net profit tracking.

## Gaps and Opportunities

### Gap 1: True Net Profit Visibility
**Problem**: Most tools show sales volume, not true profit after fees, shipping, COGS.
**Opportunity**: ResellerOS "Profit Truth" - show real ROI on every item.

### Gap 2: Intelligent Automation with Guardrails
**Problem**: Bots run blindly or require constant babysitting.
**Opportunity**: Confidence thresholds, audit logs, easy undo, human-in-loop for edge cases.

### Gap 3: ToS-Aware Automation
**Problem**: Most tools push ToS limits; users risk suspension.
**Opportunity**: "Assisted > Sketchy" - stay compliant, avoid risk.

### Gap 4: One-Photo-to-Everywhere
**Problem**: No tool delivers true photo-in -> listings-out.
**Opportunity**: ResellerOS "Take Photos, Ship Orders" - everything else automated.

### Gap 5: Mobile-First Experience
**Problem**: Only Vendoo has mobile; most are Chrome extensions.
**Opportunity**: Mobile-first design (photos taken on phone anyway).

### Gap 6: Dynamic Repricing for Individuals
**Problem**: Only enterprise tools (Hammoq) offer smart repricing.
**Opportunity**: Rule-based repricing (drop 10% after 30 days).
