# Validation Rules

## Core Principles
1. Nothing is "done" without validation
2. Validation must be documented with evidence
3. Phase transitions require checkpoint pass
4. Director must approve all transitions

## Subtask Validation
For a subtask to be marked complete:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria checked
- [ ] Deliverables exist and are complete
- [ ] No TODO/TBD markers in deliverables
- [ ] Owner confirms work is done
- [ ] No contradictions with other docs

## Phase Validation
For a phase to be complete:
- [ ] All subtasks completed AND validated
- [ ] Documentation quality verified
- [ ] Cross-reference check passed
- [ ] No blocking issues
- [ ] Director sign-off

## Evidence Requirements
Every validation must document:
- What was checked
- Pass/fail status
- Evidence (file paths, quotes, test results)
- Date and validator

## Escalation
If validation fails:
1. Document what failed
2. Create blocking issue in SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md
3. Do NOT proceed to next phase
4. Fix issues before re-validating
